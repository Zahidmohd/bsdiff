We are gonna analyze the bsdiff4 performance and do certain changes in it to impove its performance.


Bsdiff4 is a Python library for generating and applying binary patches, based on the bsdiff algorithm. The bsdiff algorithm is used to create a binary patch between two versions of a file, which can then be used to update the older version to the newer version without having to distribute the entire new file. This is particularly useful for updating software where bandwidth or storage is limited.

History and Overview:  
Developed by: Colin Percival  
Released: 2003  
Purpose: Efficiently create binary patches between two versions of a file.  
Algorithm: bsdiff uses a combination of binary differencing and compression (typically bzip2) to create small patch files.  

Measuring the performance of bsdiff4 involves evaluating several key factors. Here are some of the main criteria to consider:  
Execution Time: The time it takes to create a patch and to apply a patch.   
Memory Usage: The amount of memory consumed during the patch creation and application processes.  
Patch Size: The size of the generated patch file.  
CPU Usage: The amount of CPU resources consumed during the patch creation and application processes.  
Accuracy: Ensuring the patch correctly reconstructs the new file from the old file.
